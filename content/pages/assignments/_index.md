------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The class will be divided randomly into two groups: Group A and Group B. In each class, one group will write a memo, and the other will write a response to the memos written by their colleagues. The groups will alternate writing memos and responses. These assignments are to be based on the required readings for each class.

------------------------------------------------------------

Students will complete three mini-essays at the end of Units 1, 2, and 3. The deadline for submission is the first day of class of the subsequent unit. The goal of these essays is to give students an opportunity to reflect upon the issues discussed in class during each unit.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Students, either individually or in groups of 2â€“3, will develop a proposal for a development intervention of their choice, as if they were to be presented to a funding / supporting organization for actual implementation. The idea is to expose students to the process through which development ideas are transformed into practice, preparing them for future work in the international development field.

--------------------------------------------------------------

At the beginning of the semester, students will decide collectively on an alternative online platform (such as a Facebook group or online blog) to use for further class discussion. The engagement with the class through this alternative platform will be voluntary, but active participants will receive extra credit toward their final grade.
